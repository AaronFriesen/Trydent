# Quick Start Guide

Install Gradle, either via your favorite package manager or [here](https://gradle.org/).

To build our project, run `gradle build`. The first run may take a little while as it downloads the corresponding
dependencies.

To run only our tests, run `gradle test`. For other useful commands, see `gradle tasks`.
